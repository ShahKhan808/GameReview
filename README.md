# GameReview
Data Visualisation of all games and consoles reviewed by IGN

I took a Data Set which was freely available on the internet of all the games that IGN (popular video
game review company) reviewed out of 10 as well as the catagory of that game and the format it is
played on. 

Using this dataset, the user will be able to select through a menu which will contain at least 3 
different visualisations for example, a plot graph, line graph, bar chart, etc and I will make it
interactive so if you interacts with the graphs they will be able to see more information about it.
